# 🖼️ Image Captioning Project

This project demonstrates an **Image Captioning pipeline** using CNN + RNN architecture.  
Due to limited GPU resources, a pretrained/dummy model is used for demo purposes.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` → Sample images  
- `model/` → Pretrained/dummy model file  
- `src/` → Python source code (data preprocessing, model, inference)  
- `notebooks/` → Colab notebook with full pipeline  

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd image-captioning-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/inference.py
